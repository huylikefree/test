we had to pay the price
yeah we lost everything
we had to pay the price

i saw in you what life was missing
you lit a flame that consumed my hate
I'm not one for reminiscing but
I'd trade it all for your sweet embrace

yeah
cause we lost everything
we had to pay the price

there's a canvas with two faces
of fallen angels who loved and lost
it was a passion for the ages
and in the end guess we paid the cost

a thing of beauty - i know
will never fade away
what you did to me - i know
said what you had to say
but a thing of beauty

will never fade away
will never fade away
will never fade away

i see your eyes, i know you see me
you're like a ghost how you're everywhere
I am your demon never leaving
a metal soul of rage and fear

that one thing that changed it all
that one sin that caused the fall

a thing of beauty - I know
will never fade away
what you did to me - I know
said what you had to say
but a thing of beauty - I know
will never fade away
and I'll do my duty - I know
somehow I'll find a way
but a thing of beauty
will never fade away
and I'll do my duty

yeah
we'll never fade away
we'll never fade away
we'll never fade away
we'll never fade away

City lights, fog, strangers passing by... Watch Mike Pondsmith the creator of the pen-and-paper RPG Cyberpunk 2020® and learn about his inspirations for creating a dystopian metropolis of Night City. 

CD Projekt RED is proud to collaborate with Mike and bring this city to life in its upcoming RPG -- Cyberpunk 2077. 
The game will be set in the near future in which advanced technologies have become both the salvation and the curse of humanity. A multi-thread, nonlinear story designed for mature players (a CD Projekt RED trademark) will give players a chance  to freely roam the open-world and visit places well known from the pen-and-paper RPG ""Cyberpunk 2020®"", including a combat zone completely taken over by gangs, the legendary Afterlife joint and the nostalgic Forlorn Hope.

Welcome to the year 2077. More info: http://www.cyberpunk.net/

The teaser shows how the Psycho Squad might acquire a new member.

The Psycho Squad specializes in combating ""psychos"" -- individuals who overuse implants and substances that boost or otherwise alter the human body. 

There comes a point when they overdose on these innovations, and their bodies start to rebel against their biological body parts as well as all things organic around them. Simply put, they start killing people, who they now derisively call ""meatbags."" 

When a psycho goes on the rampage, strange things can happen. There's carnage, and the psycho might be taken down by regular police, but they're not always able to get the job done. 

When things spin out of control, they call in MAX-TAC (Maximum Force Tactical Division), popularly called the Psycho Squad.
